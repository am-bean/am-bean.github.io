Our project <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16019">LingOly</a> was selected for an Oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024! Out of more than 1800 submissions, only the top 11 (0.6%) were chosen for oral presentation, and the reviews included a recommendation for an award! I am thankful to my collaborators and the UK Linguistics Olympiad organization for their help in making this project happen. 

We created a new reasoning benchmark based on puzzles about the grammars of low-resource languages, and found that after adjusting for memorization, top language models struggle to perform reasoning tasks. Check out the paper for more details!
