Our project <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16019">PRISM</a> has won the <a href="https://blog.neurips.cc/2024/12/10/announcing-the-neurips-2024-best-paper-awards/">Best Paper Award</a> for the 2024 NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track! PRISM was selected out of more than 1800 submissions, and had some of the best reviews ever given at NeurIPS (and LingOly was <a href="https://papercopilot.com/statistics/neurips-statistics/neurips-2024-statistics-datasets-benchmarks-track/">close behind</a>!). I'm very proud of this work and of the successful ongoing collaboration with lead author Hannah Rose Kirk in this area which has led to several excellent papers.

In this work, we show the importance of considering who provides feedback for model alignment, and in the process shed light on the wide diversity of human preferences and values which apply to interactions with AI systems! Read the paper for more details!
