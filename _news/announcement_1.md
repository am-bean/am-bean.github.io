## NeurIPS Best Paper for PRISM!

Our project <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16019">PRISM</a> has won the <a href="https://blog.neurips.cc/2024/12/10/announcing-the-neurips-2024-best-paper-awards/">Best Paper Award</a> for the 2024 NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track! PRISM was selected out of more than 1800 submissions, and had some of the best reviews ever given at NeurIPS (and LingOly was <a href="https://papercopilot.com/statistics/neurips-statistics/neurips-2024-statistics-datasets-benchmarks-track/">close behind</a>!).
