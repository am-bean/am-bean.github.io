Applied analytical statistics is a course focusing on the tools and techniques used by social scientists to understand, describe and analyse (quantitative) data. It is an introductory level course, though oriented largely towards those who may have had some previous contact with mathematics or statistics in their undergraduate degrees. The focus will be on learning how to apply practical statistics in a social research context (rather than looking at fundamental mathematical foundations of statistical concepts). During the course, students will make use of the Python programming language, and hence can also expect to build familiarity with the language as they progress through the course, particularly some typical libraries for the analysis and display of data such as Pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib.
