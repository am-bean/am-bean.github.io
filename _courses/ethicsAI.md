This course presents current ethical issues in the development and application of artificial intelligence through a series of recent case studies. We will spend the first part of the course studying major ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics) and closely-linked research areas within AI and machine learning. In the second part of the course, we will apply these principles to case studies from major areas of debate in AI, with a focus on the translation of ethical principles into practical decisions.
